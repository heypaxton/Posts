Responsive background images are easy if you can control theme in your Drupal 8 theme. Once they need to be managed by a content editor it adds some difficulty. You can absolutely position and adjust the z-index of inline images but that's no fun for responsive implementations. 

# Setup

Get a fresh install of (Drupal 8)[https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.6] or use an installation you already have. 

After you install your site, go to `admin/modules`. Enable the Responsive Image module.

Now add a theme to your site. If you don't have one you can use (ThinkBase)[https://github.com/thinkshout/thinkbase]. It's a project that already has the minimum requirements of a Drupal 8 theme.
